# Software Prerequisites

In order to contribute new configuration data to the [Live Solutions Registry](../README.md), you need a few things:

1. A text editor or Integrated Development Environment.  Take your pick!
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/), to check out the existing codebase.
3. [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is used to download most of the required dependencies and run the tests.
5. [The Vagrant GPII CI plugin](https://github.com/amatas/vagrant-gpii-ci), used to manage virtual machines and run tests.
6. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), which creates and provisions virtual machines.
7. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), the environment in which the virtual machines run.
8. A computer that can run all of the above.
