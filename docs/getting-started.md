# Getting Started

The overall workflow in contributing changes to the Live Solutions Registry is as follows:

1. Install all [software prerequisites](./software-prerequisites.md).
2. Create an account on [github.com](http://github.com).
3. [Fork](http://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) [this repository](http://github.com/GPII/gpii-live-solutions-registry).
4. [Create a ticket](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) documenting your proposed changes.
5. Monitor your GitHub notifications and respond to questions on the issue.  Ideally, you would at least confirm that you are adding something that is not already in progress elsewhere.
6. [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) that matches the issue.  For example, if your issue is issue #12, you would create a branch named "gh-12".
6. Checkout your branch.
7. Make your proposed changes, editing or adding [options files](./options-files.md).
8. [Test your work locally](./running-tests.md).
9. Commit your work to your branch.
10. Submit [a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from your branch.
11. Monitor your GitHub notifications and respond to feedback from your assigned reviewer until the pull request is ready to be merged.
12. A reviewer will merge acceptable pull requests and release a new versioned of this package.
